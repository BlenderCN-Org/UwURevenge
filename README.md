# Behemoth

### Inspiration
Our inspiration came from both the android app "Protector" we made last year as well as Star Wars Battlefront space battles.

### What it does
Behemoth is a 3D real-time space shooter

### How we built it
We built the game using C# with Unity as well as free open source assets to streamline the process for the allowed time.

### Challenges we ran into
At the beginning only one member had a decent amount of knowledge with using Unity. We also had to troubleshoot some issues with github.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
We created a 3D shooter that runs well and is aesthetically pleasing.

### What we learned
We learned more about Unity and all the functionality built within it.

### What's next for Behemoth
Continue development and perhaps turn it into a full blow game.

### Built With
`blender` `c#` `photoshop` `unity` `visual-studio`
